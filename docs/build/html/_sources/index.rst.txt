**Zellij** is a Python Library for the optimization of expensive and black-box loss functions in a high dimensional search space.
To do so, it uses a combination of metaheuristics, fractal based space decomposition and tree search algorithms.
It can be used, for example, to tackle Hyperparameters Optimization problem (HPO) of deep neural networks.

   This project is under active development, and in early version.
